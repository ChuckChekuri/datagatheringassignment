## Codebook

This codebook explains the code in run_analysis.R

## Here are the main steps in the code


- loading libraries

Similarly read only the feature names we need ( first 6 )

- Next we read in the activity labels

- read test data 

- read train data

- bind all columns 

- bind all rows 

- label columns

- set descriptive activity labels

- write all the rows to measurements.csv

- select columns with Mean() and Std() only.

- create second tidy data of grouped means

- write grouped means to tidydata.csv

## Output
### Measurement.csv
```{r output, include=TRUE}
x <- read.csv("measurements.csv", nrow=10)
head(x)
```
### tidydata.csv
```{r groupedMeans, include=TRUE}
x <- read.csv("tidydata.csv", nrow=10)
head(x)
```
